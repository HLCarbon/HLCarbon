### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Henrique Lima and I've been learning data science in python and SQL since the start of the year.
Right now, I only have one project available which was my last project from the Codecademy Data scientist career path. However, more will come and the next one will be a Python program that I use for arbitraging NFT's in the IMX marketplace.
