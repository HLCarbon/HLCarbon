### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

Data Scientist with a strong foundation in statistics, Python, and SQL, gained through completing the Codecademy Data Scientist career path. My expertise includes working with powerful libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Statsmodels, and Scikit-learn.

I develop innovative features centered on AI. My work involves building robust applications using Python, C#, .NET, SQL, and MongoDB, with a focus on integrating large language models (LLMs) as AI agents. 

Some of my recent personal projects include :

Developing an AI-powered bot for trading cards from multiple games.
Creating Ebookcomparer.com, a simple website that compares ebook prices from various distributors.
Achieving a top 90 ranking on the Numerai leaderboard. Numerai is a hedge fund powered by a global network of data scientists who build machine learning models to predict financial markets. For this project, I also work with distributed spot instances on Azure to fine-tune models.
